# Hardware

The firmware is an ESP-IDF 5.x application (`firmware/esp32`) built on the portable core. The reference board uses common modules you can wire on a breadboard. Other boards are a configuration change; see [porting.md](porting.md).

## Requirements

- **Chip:** an ESP32-S3 with PSRAM is recommended (N8R8 or N16R8). Plain ESP32/S2/C3/C6 work for displays up to about 240×240 without PSRAM, provided the framebuffer (width × height × 2 bytes) fits in internal RAM next to Wi-Fi.
- **Display:** an SPI ST7789 panel (240×320, 240×240 or 240×135). Other controllers need a different `esp_lcd` panel driver.
- **Microphone:** an I2S MEMS microphone (INMP441, ICS-43434, SPH0645 style).
- **Speaker (optional):** an I2S class-D amplifier (MAX98357A) and a 4–8 Ω speaker.
- **Buttons:** at least one (TALK). The DevKit's BOOT button works; a second button for CANCEL is recommended.

## ESP32-S3 breadboard

Board option `esp32s3-breadboard`, for an ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 N8R8 and the modules above.

| Module | Signal | ESP32-S3 GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| ST7789 LCD | MOSI / SDA | 11 |
| | SCLK / SCL | 12 |
| | CS | 10 |
| | DC | 9 |
| | RST | 8 |
| | BL (backlight) | 7 |
| | VCC / GND | 3V3 / GND |
| INMP441 mic | SCK | 4 |
| | WS | 5 |
| | SD | 6 |
| | L/R | GND (left channel) |
| | VDD / GND | 3V3 / GND |
| MAX98357A amp | BCLK | 15 |
| | LRC | 16 |
| | DIN | 17 |
| | VIN / GND | 5V / GND |
| Buttons (to GND) | TALK | 0 (BOOT) |
| | CANCEL | 14 |

All pins avoid the S3's flash/PSRAM pins (26–37) and native USB (19/20). Use **Custom pins** in menuconfig to change any of them.

## Build and flash

With ESP-IDF 5.1 or later installed (`. $IDF_PATH/export.sh`):

```bash
cd firmware/esp32
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;boards/esp32s3-breadboard/sdkconfig.defaults" build
idf.py -p COM5 flash monitor
```

Or with PlatformIO, which downloads ESP-IDF itself:

```bash
cd firmware/esp32
pio run -e esp32s3-breadboard -t upload -t monitor
```

The firmware is written for ESP-IDF 5.1 and later. It has been compile-checked with ESP-IDF 6.1 through PlatformIO:

- ESP32-S3: app image 1.07 MB of the 1.5 MB partition, 13% of static RAM;
- classic ESP32 with custom pins.

On Windows, keep the project on a short path such as `C:\src\hermes-gadget-sdk`. ESP-IDF's linker-script step can exceed the Windows command-line length limit when the build directory is deeply nested.

`idf.py menuconfig` → **Hermes Gadget** sets the board, default Wi-Fi, server URL and device name. All of them can also be changed at run time over serial.

## Serial console

Open the console at 115200 baud (`idf.py monitor`, `pio device monitor`, or `hermes-gadget console --port COM5`). It shares its command set with the simulator:

```
gadget> set wifi_ssid MyWifi
@ok wifi_ssid
gadget> set wifi_pass secret
@ok wifi_pass
gadget> set server ws://192.168.1.20:8765/gadget
@ok server
gadget> status
@status {"device_id":"hg-...","phase":"online","screen":"pairing","pairing_code":"ABCD2345",...}
```

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | JSON status |
| `get <key>` | Read a setting (secrets are masked) |
| `set <key> <value>` | Write a setting; an empty value clears it |
| `say <text>` | Send a typed message |
| `talk` / `release` | Press or release TALK (bench automation) |
| `cancel` | Press CANCEL |
| `new-session` | Start a fresh conversation (same as holding CANCEL for 2 s) |
| `yes` / `no` | Answer the question on screen |
| `reconnect` | Drop and re-open the Hermes connection |
| `forget-key` | New device identity on next boot (re-enrollment and re-pairing) |
| `factory-reset` | Erase the device key and all settings |

The keys are `name`, `server`, `token`, `talk_mode` (`hold` or `tap`), `volume`, `wifi_ssid` and `wifi_pass`.

Machine-readable lines start with `@`, so tools can drive a bench device. `hermes-gadget provision` is a thin wrapper over these commands.

## Power-on sequence

1. **Boot:** about 1 s.
2. **Wi-Fi:** credentials from NVS, else from menuconfig. Without credentials the screen says "No network".
3. **Connect:** the device opens the WebSocket to `server`, retrying 1 → 30 s with backoff.
4. **Authenticate:** it enrolls its key on first contact and proves it with an HMAC afterwards.
5. **Pair or ready:** an unpaired device shows a pairing code (approve with `hermes pairing approve gadget <CODE>`); a paired one goes to **Ready**.

## Known limits of the reference firmware

- Push-to-talk or tap with energy VAD. There is no wake word; the protocol leaves room for one (`audio.start.mode`).
- Wi-Fi provisioning is over serial (or menuconfig). There is no SoftAP or BLE provisioning yet.
- There is no OTA in this release.
- The text font is ASCII only; the host folds other characters.
